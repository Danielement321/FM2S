## Abstract
Fluorescence microscopy image (FMI) denoising faces critical challenges due to the compound mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise with strong spatial correlation and the impracticality of acquiring paired noisy/clean data in dynamic biomedical scenarios. While supervised methods trained on synthetic noise (e.g., Gaussian/Poisson) suffer from out-of-distribution generalization issues, existing self-supervised approaches degrade under real FMI noise due to oversimplified noise assumptions and computationally intensive deep architectures. In this paper, we propose Fluorescence Micrograph to Self (FM2S), a zero-shot denoiser that achieves efficient FMI denoising through three key innovations: 1) A noise injection module that ensures training data sufficiency through adaptive Poisson-Gaussian synthesis while preserving spatial correlation and global statistics of FMI noise for robust model generalization; 2) A two-stage progressive learning strategy that first recovers structural priors via pre-denoised targets then refines high-frequency details through noise distribution alignment; 3) An ultra-lightweight network (3.5k parameters) enabling rapid convergence with 270Ã— faster training and inference than SOTAs. Extensive experiments across FMI datasets demonstrate FM2S's superiority: It outperforms CVF-SID by 1.4dB PSNR on average while requiring 0.1% parameters of AP-BSN. Notably, FM2S maintains stable performance across varying noise levels, proving its practicality for microscopy platforms with diverse sensor characteristics. Code and datasets will be released.

## Getting Started
It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

	conda create -n FM2S python=3.9
	conda activate FM2S
	pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data
Our experiment data are from the following links, and we acknowledge their work!
- FMD (Zhang et al. 2019) dataset. [yinhaoz/denoising-fluorescence](https://github.com/yinhaoz/denoising-fluorescence)

- SRDTrans (Li et al. 2023) dataset. [cabooster/SRDTrans](https://github.com/cabooster/SRDTrans)

Two subset for our experiment are in the `data` folder, one can use them to reproduce our results.


## Run
The starting program is in `main.py` and run the following command to denoise an image.

    python main.py -i data/TwoPhoton_MICE_1.png -o output.png -c twophoton

The arguments are explained as:
- **-i/--input_image_path:** The path for image to be denoised.
- **-o/--output_image_path:** The output path for the denoised image.
- **c/--config:** The microscope type of the input image. Stay blank for the base config.
